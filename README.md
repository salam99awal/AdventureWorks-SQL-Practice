# AdventureWorks_SQL



## OVERVIEW
This repository contains an SQL file that includes all of my solution attempts for W3r's Adventure Works SQL 100 questions. These solutions delved deep into the world of data management and SQL optimization. It was a rewarding challenge as it has not only broadened my technical knowledge but also boosted my confidence in tackling complex SQL tasks

To view the solutions, simply open the AdventureWorks files. 

If you have a more optimized solution for any of the problems, want to add explanations, or have any improvements to existing solutions, please feel free to contribute by creating a pull request.
